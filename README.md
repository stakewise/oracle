# StakeWise Oracle

## Oracle

Oracles are responsible for voting on the new ETH2 rewards for the StakeWise sETH2 tokens holders and calculating Merkle
root and proofs for the additional token distributions through the
[Merkle Distributor](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/blob/master/contracts/merkles/MerkleDistributor.sol)
contract.

### Onboarding

To get onboarded as an oracle, you have to get approved and included by the DAO. You can read more about
responsibilities and benefits of being an oracle [here](link to forum post about becoming an oracle).

### Dependencies

#### IPFS Node

The [IPFS Node](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/) is used for pinning Merkle proofs files with the reward allocations.

#### Graph Node

The [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) from the Graph Protocol is used for syncing smart
contracts data and allows oracle to perform complex queries using GraphQL. Either self-hosted (preferred)
or `https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/stakewise/stakewise-<network>`
endpoint can be used.

#### ETH2 Node

The ETH2 node is used to fetch StakeWise validators data (statuses, balances). Any ETH2 client that
supports [ETH2 Beacon Node API specification](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/) can be used:

- [Lighthouse](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/lighthouse)
- [Nimbus](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/nimbus)
- [Prym](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/prysm). Make sure to provide `--slots-per-archive-point` flag. See [Archival Beacon Node](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/advanced/beacon_node_api/)
- [Teku](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/teku)
- [Infura](https://infura.io/docs/eth2) (hosted)

### Installation

#### Option 1. Run with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Run the following command locally to build the docker image:

```shell script
docker build -f Dockerfile-oracle --pull -t stakewise-oracle:latest .
```

**You can also use [pre-build images](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/stakewiselabs/GLOBAL/oracle)**

#### Option 2. Build with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

```shell script
poetry install --no-dev
```

### Usage

#### 1. Create an environment file with [Settings](#settings)

```shell script
cat >./local.env <<EOL
NETWORK=mainnet
ETH2_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000
IPFS_PINATA_API_KEY=<pinata api key>
IPFS_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=<pinata secret key>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws key id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws secret access key>
ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<private_key>
EOL
```

#### 2. Start Oracle

Option 1. Run with Docker

Run the following command locally to start the oracle:

```shell script
docker run --env-file ./local.env gcr.io/stakewiselabs/oracle:latest
```

where `local.env` is an environment file with [Settings](#settings).

Option 2. Run with Poetry

Run the following command locally to start the oracle:

```shell script
poetry run python oracle/main.py
```

## Keeper

Keeper is responsible for aggregating votes that were submitted by all the oracles and will submit the update transaction.
The keeper does not require any additional role in the smart contracts and can be executed by anyone.
